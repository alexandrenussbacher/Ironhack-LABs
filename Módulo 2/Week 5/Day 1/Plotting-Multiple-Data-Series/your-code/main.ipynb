In the lesson, you learned how to leverage multi-line charts, side-by-side bar charts, and scatter plots/matrices. In this lab, you'll gain additional experience plotting multiple data series in a single visualization with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.\n","\n","## Getting Started\n","\n","There are a bunch of questions to be solved. If you get stuck in one exercise you can skip to the next one. Read each instruction carefully and provide your answer beneath it.\n","\n","## Resources\n","\n","- [Pandas Plotting Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html)\n","- [Seaborn Tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)\n","- [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O-AX1lB8vN1G","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Plotting Multiple Data Series\n","\n","Complete the following set of exercises to solidify your knowledge of plotting multiple data series with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

For some of the exercises in this lab, you will need to transform the data into the form most appropriate for generating the visualization and then create the plot."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"tPJpU7UTvN1K","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import warnings\n","\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","%matplotlib inline"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"aVuRc-S4vN1Q","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["data = pd.read_csv('../data/liquor_store_sales.csv')\n","data.head()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TCW6g1HbvN1V","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.
